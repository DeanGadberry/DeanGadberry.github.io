<h2>1. Describing Dean Gadberry With the Diversity Wheel</h2>
<div style="text-indent: 4em;">
    <p>
        If I were to be described via the Diversity Wheel, the practical approach to life which I live would readily be seen. 
        The truth of Jesus Christ's eminent return (Religious Beliefs) undergirds all of my actions in this life.
        This, along with my duties as a Husband (Marital Status) and Father (Parental Status), is the dominant building block for my worldview. 
        In fact, it is what drove me toward the commitment to my family which I hold so dear. 
        God teaches me that I have few valuable contributions to this fallen world. 
        I am a sinner who has rejected God since my conception, and I need Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice, if I am to contribute in any meaningful way. 
        Everyone in this world is in need of the same help. 
        The only solution to every ailment on this planet is the saving grace received via belief in Jesus Christ's death, burial, and resurrection, and an understanding that he will return to judge the living and the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
        The faith I have in God frightens me to submission to his holy will. 
        I seek to glorify him, and fail utterly.
        The Bible teaches me that I should love my family and provide for them.
        This is why I am married and seek the expansion of my lineage. 
        My family is growing, and that influences my worldview as well. 
        I have a wife to please, and a baby to provide for. 
        I must make goals and achieve them so that my wife will have the stability which she so desperately needs. 
        I must represent Christ for her and my child - a task which I will never complete perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
        My family is the most important physical thing in my life, and I am their sole protector.
        I am vigilant and cautious in this world, as it presents many dangers.
        I am an advocate for gun rights, as a firearm is the best shot I have to prevent an attacker from impeding on my family and their freedom to live a prosperous life.
        The reason that I am staying informed about the events in this world is so that I may hedge against the dangers which are rising and out of control.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I know that my family is taken care of, I proceed to working with people and computers.
        I am especially skilled at solving problems (Functional Specialty).
        I often find myself working in a role which requires interacting with many people or many systems. 
        The improvements available in the lives of those around me and the software which I interact with are especially obvious, and I find myself presenting solutions to the issues which I see.

<h2>2. How Culture, Ethnicity, and Gender Influence Communication</h2>
<div style="text-indent: 4em;">
    <p>
        Culture influences communication in many ways.
        In Dubai, I was advised to be careful when using the world "Christian" as it would often elicit memories of The Crusaders and their conquests in the Middle East.
        Only once was I asked by one especially knowledgeable man, whether I was Catholic or Protestant.
        Different cultures view Christians with different notions. 
        Christianity is not the only object of debate interculturally. 
        Many subjects may be lost in translation from one culture to another. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Ethnicity is a large part of interrelational communication, internationally.
        Now, in America, one might argue that one may not be an American, simply, but that one must be allegiant to those of their race, instead.
        This wedge, driven between countrymen in this nation has been used to discredit certain people. 
        Now, one is not asked to only defend their ideals, but also their background.
        They are asked to defend the history of their generations - a task which is impossible, as all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gender is a wildly divisive subject today, but thankfully, the Bible speaks on this subject.
        According to God, men are to lead and love, and women are to submit and be homemakers.
        Communication between men and women is highly dependent on their understanding of their role in this society, and if men are not prepared to stand up and speak out about their willingness to sacrifice their own desires for the benefit of their family, the world will face a quick end.
        A man must be prepared to soften his direct way of speaking for the ease of understanding for his wife. 
        Men must also be prepared to speak boldly to the leaders of their communities about their needs and the solutions which will benefit everyone involved.
        Women, likewise, will need to acknowledge the nature of men which lead.
        They may notice that men are gruff and unforgiving.
        They are allowed to forgive this difference so that the leaders may lead.
        Women, in their genteel way, are a voice of reason, and often helpful to the refining of a man's speech.
